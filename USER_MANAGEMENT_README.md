## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

#### 401 Unauthorized
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_CREDENTIALS",
        "message": "Invalid email or password"
    }
}
```

#### 403 Forbidden
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Access denied. Insufficient permissions."
}
```

#### 404 Not Found
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "User not found"
}
```

#### 422 Validation Error
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "errors": {
        "email": ["The email field is required."],
        "password": ["The password must be at least 8 characters."]
    }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed using Laravel's `Hash::make()`
- Minimum password length: 8 characters
- Password confirmation required for changes

### Token Security
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication
- Tokens are automatically revoked on logout
- Tokens are revoked when password is changed

### Role Protection
- Admin-only endpoints are protected by `role:Admin` middleware
- Users cannot access endpoints they don't have permission for
- Last admin user cannot be deleted

### File Upload Security
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure file naming
- Automatic cleanup

## Activity Logging

The system automatically logs all user activities including:
- User creation, updates, and deletion
- Profile changes
- Password changes
- Login/logout events
- Role assignments

Activity logs can be accessed via the `/api/users/{id}/activity-log` endpoint.

## Testing

### Postman Collection
Import the `User_Management_Postman_Collection.json` file into Postman to test all endpoints.

### Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables in Postman:
- `base_url`: Your API base URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8001`)
- `auth_token`: Authentication token (automatically set after login)

### Test Flow
1. Login with admin credentials
2. Copy the token from the response
3. Set the `auth_token` environment variable
4. Test all other endpoints

## Database Schema

### Users Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email_verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('Admin', 'Manager', 'User') DEFAULT 'User',
    avatar_url VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    remember_token VARCHAR(100) NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL
);
```
